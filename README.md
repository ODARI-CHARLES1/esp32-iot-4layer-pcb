# ESP32 IoT 4-Layer PCB

This project focuses on the design and development of a **4-layer PCB** for an **ESP32-based IoT device**. The goal is to create a compact, robust, and EMI-optimized PCB layout suitable for IoT applications.

---

## Project Overview

- **Microcontroller:** ESP32-WROOM-32 (or compatible module)
- **PCB Layers:** 4 (Signal–Ground–Power–Signal stackup)
- **Purpose:** General-purpose IoT hardware platform for prototyping and deployment
- **Tools Used:** KiCad (v6/v7), Git for version control

---

## Design Highlights

- **4-layer stackup** for improved signal integrity and reduced EMI
- Compact layout with modular headers for sensors and peripherals
- On-board voltage regulation (LDO or buck converter)
- USB-to-UART for programming and debugging
- Decoupling and impedance control best practices
- Optional: Antenna matching network for Wi-Fi/BLE

##  Getting Started

1. Open the project in **KiCad v6 or later**
2. Explore `*.kicad_sch` and `*.kicad_pcb` files
3. Run DRC/ERC checks
4. Generate or review the BOM and Gerbers
5. Export fabrication files for PCB manufacturing
